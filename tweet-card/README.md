## Description

Twitter Embed is a simple card that displays a single tweet from Twitter. It includes the user's avatar, name, username, the tweet itself, the total number of likes, and the date it was published. The design is intended to be easily integrated into other websites and provides a way for users to view and interact with a tweet without leaving the page they are on. The design is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to quickly and easily access the content they are interested in.
